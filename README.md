Feather is a free and open-source optimization modpack for the Minecraft client that improves frame rates, reduces micro-stutter, adds quality of life fixes, and fixes graphical issues in Minecraft. It works mostly on the **client**, and doesn't require the modpack to be installed on servers.

### What makes Feather different?
One of the most important design goals in Feather is quality. Unlike other modpacks which put all of the mods they see on Modrinth, Feather makes sure to always choose the best, and if there is over one mod that does something, we check which one works the best.

If you do encounter an issue where Feather crashes or has any bugs, don't hesitate to open an issue. Each mod is carefully checked to ensure quality, but after all, bugs and crashes are unavoidable. Before opening a new issue, please check using the search tool that your issue has not already been created, and that if there is a suitable template for the issue you are opening, that it is filled out entirely. Issues which are duplicates or do not contain the necessary information to triage and debug may be closed.

### Mods
We have a variety of mods to improve performance, but we also include some QoL mods.
