<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.

Feather is a free and open-source optimization modpack for Minecraft that improves frame rates, reduces micro-stutter, adds quality of life fixes, and fixes graphical issues in Minecraft. It works mostly on the **client**, and doesn't require the modpack to be installed on servers.

### What makes Feather different?
One of the most important design goals in Feather is quality. Unlike other modpacks which put all of the mods they see on Modrinth, Feather makes sure to always choose the best, and if there is over one mod that does something, we check which one works the best.

If you do encounter an issue where Feather crashes or has any bugs, don't hesitate to open an issue. Each mod is carefully checked to ensure quality, but after all, bugs and crashes are unavoidable. Before opening a new issue, please check using the search tool that your issue has not already been created, and that if there is a suitable template for the issue you are opening, that it is filled out entirely. Issues which are duplicates or do not contain the necessary information to triage and debug may be closed.
